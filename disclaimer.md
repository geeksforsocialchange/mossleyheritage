# Heritage trail disclaimer

The Trails were prepared with great care and were all checked at the time they were published. However, changes to the landscape and the environment can happen over time, weather conditions, construction projects, closures or other events may cause directions to differ from advice given. We cannot accept any responsibility for any inaccuracies that result from any such changes.

When following the trails you are entirely responsible for your own safety and that of any accompanying children and/or pets. Always exercise common sense, judgement and caution.

Walking anywhere carries a degree of risk. Mossley is a hilly town and some of the trails are on steep paths. Most of the trails are easy but it is up to users to ensure they are capable of undertaking the trail and users should be equipped to deal with changing weather conditions and uneven terrain.

Cobbled streets, unadopted roads, potentially slippery stone paths, bridges, potholes, canal paths, busy roads with traffic should all be carefully navigated, we accept no responsibility for any personal accident , injury or public liability while following these walks.

While following the trails using a map or a phone, care should always be taken that you look where you are going, we accept no responsibility for any accident that results from you being unaware of your surroundings.
