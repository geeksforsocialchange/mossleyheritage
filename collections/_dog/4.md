Shirley was on a mission - she had heard that some sheep rustlers had been caught and really wanted to see them to warn her friends what they looked like.

Policing in Mossley was a very complicated affair as due to its position the town sat in three counties - Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire. This meant they had three different police forces, three parish churches and three administrations! Criminals had to be arrested by the correct police officers depending on which bit of the town they were in and then, after a night in the cell, they were taken to one of three different court houses.

Once Shirley had heard that a man had drowned in the canal and the Cheshire police had taken a long pole and pushed the body over the boundary into Lancashire so that they didn't have to deal with the investigation.

Since the population of the town had grown so much, Shirley saw the emergency services in action nearly every day. Mossley had its own ambulance and the fire station at Roaches Lock was kept busy with the many mill fires.

Shirley was a super sleuth for about an hour but then she started to feel hungry. She wandered off in search of scraps, safe in the knowledge that the town was in good hands and the sheep rustlers would be properly punished.

The Mossley shield shows 3 symbols: a red rose, a white rose and a sheath of corn.

Which belongs to which county? What is the flower in the middle?
