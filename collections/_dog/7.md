Shirley the sheepdog was looking over the wall watching the busy train station and reminiscing about before the station opened in 1849 when she was just a pup.

It was hard to remember Mossley without the train line running through it but it had taken years of hard work to cut through the huge rocks, especially the long tunnel at Scout Green. Now passengers and of course goods such as cotton could travel all the way from Liverpool to Leeds and beyond.

The station itself had been built to look very smart almost like a church. This helped Mossley residents, who had never seen trains before, (despite the screeching, hissing noise and clouds of steam) feel they were nothing to be scared of.

It semed to have worked, the trains were crowded these days and especially so this week. So much so that the London and North Western Railway had to lay on extra trains to cope with the many people who wanted to travel to Mossley.

It was all because of a huge fire at Britannia Mill. Sightseers from near and far came to look at the smouldering ruins on their day off from work.

CAN YOU FIND THE REMAINS OF A WELL ON THE HUDDERSFIELD PLATFORM?

John Radcliffe (1806-1861) and his family lived in a house where Mossley Station now stands and the well which was used for drinking water. In 1847 the houses were demolished to make way for the railway.
