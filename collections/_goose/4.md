directions: Old All Saints Church.
year: 1893
title: George visits the New Church
teaser: It was 1893 and George had waddled over to watch a very important event. That morning the goose had seen 21 schoolboys from St James School pile into a horse drawn coach and set off on a trip to Belle Vue Zoo. That would be a long and bumpy ride!
