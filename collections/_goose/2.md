George had waddled all the way to the top of Micklehurst Roadd and it was hot and he needed a rest. He noticed the big stone house on the corner that was called the Shepherds Home and that the door was propped open.

There were men stood outside carrying crooks and wearing long black and white robes. They kind of looked like shepherds but more the kind you would see in the bible. 

**They weren't real shepherds they were member of the Ancient Order of Shepherds who collected a small amount of money off the mill workers of Mossley. Then if anyone who paid fell sick they would pay for doctors and medicine, if someone lost their job they would ensure the family still had food and if someone died they would pay for their funeral.**

What George needed at that moment was some shade, so he snuck past the men and through the open door. As he entered the cool interior he could hear lots of noise from the top of the house. George was curious so he flapped and waddled his way right up to the attic. 

There he found lots of people playing games, holding competitions and generally having a good time. They were delighted to have a goose join in the fun and made him very welcome. George decided he liked those Shepherds. They might dress a bit weirdly but they helped people and threw really good parties!

The Abney Branch Church opposite was connected to Abney Church that used to be on Abney Road.

However, it survived much longer, and eventually shut in 2018. This photo is of a pantomime at the Church in the 1950s.
