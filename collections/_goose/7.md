George crossed the River Tame via Red Herring bridge and hoped onto a horse drawn delivery wagon trundling up Waggon road for a trip to the shops on Mossley Brow to see what tasty morsels he might find.

At the grocers somebody had spilled some dried peas so he nibbled on them while the driver popped into the newsagent to buy the Reporter.

Next stop was the wool shop, there was nothing to eat there but the little girl who lived there came out and tied a woollen bow round George's neck.

At the greengrocers, George managed to pinch a whole cob of corn without anyone noticing, but he held his beak against the smell of poultry coming from the butcher's shop.

He tried sneaking into the bakery to pinch a bun but the baker was in a grumpy mood and chased the cheeky goose right out of his shop. George didn't really mind because the next stop was his favourite - the fish and chip shop.

He lurked by the door and the next person who walked out eating their chips got a peck on the leg. He gave the lad such a fright that his chips went flying and the lad was so embarrassed in front of the queue of people waiting for their supper that he hurried away with a red face.

"Tee hee," thought George, "it works every time," and tucked into a nice pile of freshly cooked chips with salt and vinegar.

His final stop was a good slurp from the milk churns that were on the cool stones at the back of the dairy and then George hopped back on the wagon to get a lift down the hill.

He loved Mossley, you could really get anything you wanted here!
