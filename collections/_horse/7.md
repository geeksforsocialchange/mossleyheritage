Hannah and her cart were waiting outside the Soldiers and Sailors Recreation Room. There was an open sack of carrots leaning up against the wall outside. Hannah couldn't resist and started nibbling at a carrot and before she knew it she had eaten the whole sack!

Suddenly she noticed that there were several men queuing up next to her. One was on crutches, one was missing an arm, two had eye patches and another couldn't stop shaking. They were talking to each other about how much they were looking forward to a nice hot bowl of carrot soup.

Hannah started to feel horribly guilty as she realised she had eaten all the carrots for the soup. She quickly trotted over to the Co-Op that sold vegetables where the grocer's boy absentmindedly loaded her cart with a sack of turnips. As she pulled up back at the soup kitchen she really hoped the men liked turnip soup even better than carrot soup.

![Mossley workers at Brittania Mill]()

This photograph is a still taken from a film of Mossley workers streaming out of Brittania Mill and walking up Queen Street in 1900 (you can see it on the BFI website). But by the 1920s Mossley's mills were in decline with unemployment reaching 56%. Long queues formed outside the labour exchange. By 1926 Mossley was a desperately poor town.

CAN YOU FIND THE OLD BANK IN THIS PICTURE?

A bank robber once pulled up outside on his motorbike ana ran in to demand money. The receptionist had to calmly explain that the old bank was now a doctor's surgery!
