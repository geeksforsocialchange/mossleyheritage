Hannah snorted loudly as she pulled the cart full of milk churns up Old Brow. She stopped at Valeside while people came out to fetch their milk and she watched a lady kneeling in front of her house scrubbing her step with a donkey stone. She was obviously very proud about keeping her step clean. There was a dip in the step from her scrubbing it so often.

In the next house the door was open and Hannah could see a man sat in front of the fire in a tin bath. She heard a child’s voice pipe up:

“Dad please don’t stay in the bath too long, there is mum and the other four to go before me. I hate that just because I’m the youngest I always get the cold dirty water!!”

As Hannah got to the last house in the row she saw the pig bin was waiting to be collected. A tasty carrot top poked out the top she just grabbed it when a loud beep made her rear up and the pig bin went flying. No-one noticed though because everyone was staring at a metal contraption came roaring and beeping down the cobbled hill. It was a motor car!! The first one that Hannah had ever seen.

“I remember going to tea at my aunties. They had no bathroom and their bath was in the kitchen, not a tin bath but a proper bath with a removable worktop over it, the toilet was outside.”

Eli Whalley in Ashton produced 2.5m donkey stones a year during its heyday in the 1930s. He used a lion as his trademark inspired by childhood visits to Belle Vue Zoo.

The first motor car used in Mossley was a 3-wheel Morgan owned in 1907 by a yarn salesman who worked at Southend Mill. Dr Cameron owned the second, a Star in 1908. He drove behind a red flag.
