Hannah and the other horses were very excited. They had been brought to the stables behind Whitehall and groomed until they shone, then ribbons had been plaited in their manes and tails.

They were going to be in a grand parade to celebrate Whitehall becoming Mossley's new Town Hall. They trotted through the tunnel that led downfrom the stables to Stamford Road.

There they joined the parade that was over a mile long with 4000 people in it!

There were seven bands, and Hannah was pleased she was in front of her favourite, one of the reed bands. The streets were decorated with bunting and the Sunday schools flew their silk banners. The Ancient Order of Shepherds, dressed in their robes, were in front of her and they had a wagon in the shape of a pen of sheep complete with lambs and sheepdog.

The mayoress gave out 4000 buns and oranges to the children and asked that in return: "They never do any damage to the trees and flowers around the Town Hall or stand around and see others do damage."

Hannah thought this was very wise and was very pleased when one of the children gave her a yummy bun.

Whitehall was built by George Mayall for his wife but she died before it was finished so never lived there.

It was sold to the Town Council for Â£4,000, which was less than the cost of the orange fireplace in the house.

It was used as the Town Hall offices until it was sold in 1989.
