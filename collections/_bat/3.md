It was twilight and outside The George Hotel it was very busy. Coaches were pulling up and setting off as people streamed in and out. 

The Celerity Coach sped past Bugler so fast he nearly went into a nose dive. It would be on its way to the Bull's Head.

Bugler thought that after a child had been knocked over and killed only a few weeks before the coach might have learnt to slow down a little while driving through town.

In fact the inquest into the death had just finished and the magistrates were just leaving the George.

There was a bit of a kerfuffle as they bumped into the ladies and gentlemen who, dressed in their finest clothes, were crowding in to the hotel to attend a concert that was on there that evening.

Can you tell where this photo is? Which houses have been knocked down and what is there instead?

The Bull's Head (now demolished) at the top of Stamford Street was central to Mossley life. The post was delivered and collected from there every morning.

During the American Civil War the landlord would read out the newspaper for everyone to hear. The Celerity stagecoach travelling between Huddersfield and Manchester called there four times a week.

The Pilot stagecoach travelling from Leeds to Manchester called at The Pack Horse at Mossley Cross, The British Queen and The Victoria ran along Manchester Road and called at The Commercial.
