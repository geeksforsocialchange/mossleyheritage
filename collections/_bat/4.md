Bugler Bat had found himself a very cosy place to sleep, folded into a black cloth in a contraption in Mr. Smith's wooden photography booth, perched overlooking bottom Mossley.

He was sound asleep when he was awoken by a loud pop and a flash of light. He shot out, spreading his wings in shock and saw Mr Smith had his head under the cloth. A happy couple with the lady all dressed in white were in front of him. Bugler didn't realise but he'd just done the first bat photo bomb in history!

Disorientated he flew out of the photo shop and into the fish and chip shop. It was hot and noisy in there, so after chomping on a couple of flies that were buzzing round the fish waiting to be fried he zoomed into the cool dark tranquillity of the sweet shop with it's rows of glass jars and settled himself in behind a jar of strawberry bonbons.

He woke at dusk and flew out onto Brookfields where he saw a group of children with square satchels slung over their shoulders and labels tied round their necks. Flying round them and listening to their chatter (a mixture of scared, relieved and sad) he realised they were evacuees sent to Mossley from big cities which were being bombed. They had to live with other families until it was safe to go home. 

Bugler followed the children to The Mechanics Institute where people were waiting to choose the children they wanted. Strong looking boys were quickly taken by local farmers whereas older girls were popular with house wives wanting help around the house.

Bugler Bat felt sorry for these children and thought being picked like this was a very harsh way to start a new life. He noticed a small boy hiding behind a tall girl hoping not to be picked at all so he would be sent home to his mum and dad. He did eventually get picked by the lady from the sweet shop.

Bugler Bat was relieved as he knew the boy would be much safer in Mossley and felt sure he would cheer up once he'd tasted those strawberry bonbons.
