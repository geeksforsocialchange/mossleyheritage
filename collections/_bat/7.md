It was dawn and Bugler Bat was looking for a place to roost for the day after a busy night's hunting. Suddenly he heard the most horrendous screeching noise and as he flew across Stamford Road he saw an incredible and terrifying sight.

Hurtling down the road towards him was the morning tram with the conductor desperately pulling on the brake lever. Despite the conductor's efforts the tram just got faster and faster with sparks flying from the tracks. As it reached the bend at the bottom of Stamford Road it flew off the tracks, hit the far side of the railway bridge and somersaulted onto the train track.

People poured out of their houses at the noise, some to stand and gawk but others rushing to help the injured and dying.

Bugler suddenly thought about the trains that would soon be arriving and flew down the track flapping his wings furiously luckily he was not the only one so quick thinking and men with flags had run down the tracks in both directions to stop oncoming trains and avoid further tragedy.
