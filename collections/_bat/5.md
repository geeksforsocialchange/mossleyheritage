Bugler was snoozing in the eaves of a brand new chapel. It had been officially opened on Wednesday and a few people had come to the service but nothing had disturbed his sleep too much.

In between hunting for his supper he spent the next few nights flapping around the new building and had found quite a few interesting things. There was a very large kitchen and a billiard table. He found the script for a pantomime lying open on the table and on Saturday night a huge pile of freshly baked buns (which he sampled and deemed to be delicious).

So after a busy night and full of bun he settled in for a peaceful Sunday sleep. So much for that - he was rudely awoken by the loudest singing he had ever heard. He opened his eyes and saw over a thousand people joyously singing their hearts out whilst someone ferociously pumped out hymns on a pedal organ. Bugler couldn't help admire their enthusiasm but decided he definitely wouldn't try sleeping here again!

The Unitarian Chapel was famous for its plays and pantomimes.

People made their own entertainment at this time and plays and pantomimes were very popular. Chapels like the Unitarians put on regular performances - it's interesting that this tradition still flourishes in Mossley today due to MAODS.

The school at the Unitarian Chapel claimed to be the 'leading educational centre of the town'. There were 80 teachers and along with the 3R's (taught in all schools) lessons were also given in astronomy, geography and other scientific subjects.
