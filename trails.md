## About the Mossley Heritage Trails

A team of 134 project workers with ages ranging from 8–84 (powered by a shared enthusiasm for heritage) trawled the internet, read local books, studied old photos, mined the memories of relatives and explored the archives at the heritage centre to ensure that the trails bring the Mossley of the past to life.

Volunteers worked alongside Green Monster Arts and pupils from all five Mossley primary schools to plot, walk, research stories, create characters and provide a narrative for five Mossley heritage trails.

The project was grant funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.
