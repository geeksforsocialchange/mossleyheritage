# A Dog's Life

Shirley the Sheepdog rounded up the Year 6 children of St Joseph’s School and showed them what ‘A Dog’s Life’ was like in Mossley through the ages. Along the way they met famous people such as George Lawton and Ernest Sykes as well as a former Lord Mayor of Mossley otherwise known as Grandpa Sticks! A link to a small town in Australia was discovered along with the rather stinky details of emptying outside toilets.
