# As the Crow Flies

Mr Pickles the Crow and Year 5 at Milton St John’s School flew through the history of our town uncovering romantic adventures, waving men off to war and imagining the sound of hundreds of clogs clattering on cobbles. Pupils found blueprints of mill houses and shared stories from their grandparents, as well as learning about how children of their age would be working in the mills not so long ago. ‘As The Crow Flies’ shares these with you.
