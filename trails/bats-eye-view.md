    description: John had been a brave soldier and with Bugler had been on many adventures during the Peninsular and Pyrenees Wars. Between 1815 to 1825 John blew his bugle and beat his drum. Bugler would stay hidden in his hat and John reckoned that his good fortune was down to having a lucky bat in his hat!

# A Bat's Eye View

Bugler Bat and Beech Class at St George’s School carried out research that took them to the Peninsular and Pyrenees Wars and back to the first Co-op shop in Tameside, travelling by both stagecoach and tram. Uncovering details of the tram crash, the story of Annaville Terrace and the role of Mossley in World War 2 were highlights of ‘A Bat’s Eye View’.

Starting point of trail

> Bugler Bat was dangling from the Lych Gate at St Georges Church thinking about his old friend John Whitworth.
