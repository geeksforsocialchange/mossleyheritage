Bugler Bat and Beech Class at St George’s School carried out research that took them to the Peninsular and Pyrenees Wars and back to the first Co-op shop in Tameside, travelling by both stagecoach and tram. Uncovering details of the tram crash, the story of Annaville Terrace and the role of Mossley in World War 2 were highlights of ‘A Bat’s Eye View’.
