      <p class="bigger--on-portrait">In 1966, a year best known for England winning the World Cup, a group of stalwart citizens were so proud of their small town of Mossley that they determined to create an organisation which would observe, debate and aim to protect and celebrate the heritage of their community.</p>
      <p class="bigger--on-portrait">And so the Mossley Civic Society was born.</p>

To celebrate our local heritage we share, listen, talk, display, present, teach, perform, write, collect, organise, stimulate, participate, explore and investigate.

We do whatever we can to keep Mossley Heritage in the collective consciousness of Mossley folk.

The committee consists of up to 14 members while the whole group numbers between 40 and 50, all of whom are passionate about Mossley.
